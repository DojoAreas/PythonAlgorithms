# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability in **TheAlgorithms/Python**, please follow these steps to report it:

1. **Do not open an issue or pull request**: To ensure that the vulnerability is handled responsibly and securely, please **do not create a public issue or PR**. This will allow us to address the issue in a secure manner before any information becomes public.

2. **Contact the maintainers**: Send a detailed description of the vulnerability to **[security@thealgorithms.com]**. Please include the following information:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue, if applicable.
   - Any relevant code or configuration files.
   - Your contact details (optional).

   If you don't have a direct contact, feel free to create a private email or open a responsible disclosure channel via GitHub Discussions, with a direct request to the maintainers.

3. **Timeline for Response**: We strive to respond to all security reports within 48 hours. The severity of the issue may affect the response time.

## Security Measures

- **Vulnerability Fixes**: Once a vulnerability is identified and reported, we will work to fix it as soon as possible. We will issue a patch release if necessary.
- **Security Advisory**: We will provide a public security advisory with the details of the vulnerability, once the patch has been released. This advisory will include steps for users to mitigate the issue.

## Secure Coding Practices

We follow the best practices in secure coding to ensure our code is resilient against common security vulnerabilities, including but not limited to:
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure handling of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys)
- Proper encryption and decryption mechanisms
- Avoiding common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows

## Data Handling

We recommend that contributors and users do not store sensitive data (such as passwords or private keys) in the repository. Any sensitive information should be handled securely, using appropriate encryption or key management tools.

## Patching and Updates

We encourage contributors to regularly update dependencies to minimize security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

## Additional Resources

For more information on secure coding practices and related resources, you can refer to:
- [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)
- [CWE - Common Weakness Enumeration](https://cwe.mitre.org/)

## Responsible Disclosure

We adhere to responsible disclosure practices and ask that any vulnerabilities be reported privately. We are committed to working with the security community to address any issues as quickly and efficiently as possible.
