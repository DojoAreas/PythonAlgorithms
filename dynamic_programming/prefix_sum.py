This is an implementation of the Dynamic Programming solution to the Range Sum Query problem.

The problem statement is:
    Given an array and q queries,
    each query stating you to find the sum of elements l to r (inclusive) (l and r are given in the query)

Example:
    arr = [1, 4, 6, 2, 61, 12]
    queries = 3
    l_1 = 2, r_1 = 5
    l_2 = 1, r_2 = 5
    l_3 = 3, r_3 = 4

    as input will return

    [81, 85, 63]

    as output

    [0-indexing]

NOTE:- 0-indexing means the indexing of the array starts from 0
Example:- a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
          Here, the 0th index of a is 1,
                the 1st index of a is 2,
                and so forth

Time Complexity:- O(N + Q)
-- O(N) pre-calculation time to calculate the prefix sum array
-- and O(1) time per each query = O(1 * Q) = O(Q) time

Space Complexity:- O(N)
-- O(N) to store the prefix sum

Algorithm:-
So first we calculate the prefix sum (dp) of the array.
The prefix sum of the index i is the sum of all elements indexed from 0 to i (inclusive)
The prefix sum of the index i is the prefix sum of index i-1 + the current element.
So, The state of the dp is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + a[i];

After we calculate the prefix sum,
For each query [l, r]
The answer is dp[r]-dp[l-1] ( we need to be careful because l might be 0 )
For example take this array:-
    [4, 2, 1, 6, 3]
The prefix sum calculated for this array would be:-
    [4, 4+2, 4+2+1, 4+2+1+6, 4+2+1+6+3]
==> [4, 6, 7, 13, 16]
If the query was l=3, r=4,
The answer would be 6+3 = 9 but this would require O(r-l) time â‰ˆ O(N) time
If we use prefix sums we can find it in O(1) time by using the formula prefix[r]-prefix[l-1]
This formula works because prefix[r] is the sum of elements from [0, r] and prefix[l-1] is the sum of elements from [0, l-1],
so if we do prefix[r]-prefix[l-1] it will be [0, r] - [0, l-1] = [0, l-1] + [l, r] - [0, l-1] = [l, r]
